# MMORTS

Purpose of this project is creating [MMORTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_real-time_strategy_game) game. The core idea is that players are supposed to actively use scripting for automation of routine actions, such as: base management, units control, researching, manufacturing and so on.

## World description

The current idea is that the world is a computer simulation with it's own chemistry and physics: materials with procedurally generated properties, different [physical fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)), alternative two-dimensional spaces including warp spaces.

## Scripting

The are two types of scripting are supposed. The first is more like task management system, where player creates some rules and tasks and orders them by setting priorities. The second is much more programmer's way - player writes code with high level programming language using game API (of course with restrictions for the sake of security).
